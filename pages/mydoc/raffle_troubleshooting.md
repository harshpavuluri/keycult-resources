## Issues authenticating on raffle.keycult.com

Problem: You have created a Discord account but are unable to successfully authenticate on <https://raffle.keycult.com>.

Steps to take:

1. Ensure you have joined the Keycult Discord server at <https://discord.gg/keycult>
2. Ensure that you have agreed to our Server Rules by reacting with ✅ to the last message in the #welcome channel. Depending on when you joined the server, you may have to verify your account with your phone number.
3. Log out on <https://raffle.keycult.com> and log back in with your Discord account.

## Confirming access to raffles

There are a few ways to check:

1. If you have the `Verified` role in the Keycult Discord server, you should be good to go.
2. If you can send messages in the Keycult Discord server, you should be good to go.
3. If you can authenticate and see either the raffle or the “No raffles currently available” message on <https://raffle.keycult.com>, you should be good to go.


## Can't see the raffle? "Looks like we're not currently running any raffles"

Try a hard-refresh using `Ctrl-Shift-R`.
