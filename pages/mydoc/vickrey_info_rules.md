## What is a Vickrey Auction?
A Vickrey auction is an auction where participants submit bids privately and the winner pays the price set by the second highest bidder. For example if 10 boards were being auctioned, the top ten bidders would pay the price set by the eleventh highest bidder.

Example top bids
 - #1 - $900
 - #2 - $850
 - #3 - $850
 - #4 - $825
 - #5 - $800
 - #6 - $800
 - #7 - $775
 - #8 - $750
 - #9 - $710
 - #10 - $700
 - #11 - $650 ← The top 10 each pay $650

Your bid represents the maximum amount you are willing to pay, but the actual sale price is determined by the other participants. In the example above, even though #1 bid $950, they only paid $650. This is the market price: the price at which there are enough buyers willing to pay for the item.

The auction will be silent, so no bids will be visible during or after the auction. Each participant is allowed only 1 bid. So make sure to bid only the maximum you are willing and can pay. You will be met with repercussions if you are not able to pay.

After the auction period is complete, there will be at least a day to process results and send out invoices.

A Vickrey Auction will not happen often. Usually, Vickrey auctions are run for very limited special editions that are at the discretion of Keycult. 


## General Vickery Rules

These rules apply to all vickreys conducted by Keycult. Failure to abide by them may get you disqualified, banned, or blacklisted from future raffles and releases.

 - You have 10 hours to enter on auction day (10am to 8pm EDT) and cannot change your bid after you submit! Please be sure of your submission and take your time.
 - You may not bid on behalf of someone else or agree ahead of time to sell your slot to someone else if you win.
 - If you win, you will receive an invoice through our Shopify storefront and will have 24 hours to complete payment. **We do not accept PayPal.**

                            Demand for our boards is currently much higher than our supply. While we are increasing the number of kits available during our raffles, we do not anticipate keeping up with demand in the near future. This leads to an aftermarket where kits sell for dramatically more than what we charge. Contrary to what some may think, we do not have any ill-will towards people who resell Keycult kits for profit. But if we could capture some of that profit, it would bring us closer to becoming a sustainable, long-term business.
                            To that end, we think a Vickrey auction will have a couple of key benefits:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Those willing to spend significantly more for a kit will be able to purchase one through the auction instead of through the aftermarket, benefiting Keycult financially.</li>
                                <li>The auction takes top spenders out of the market, making it less attractive for people to enter the main sale with the intent to resell their kit for profit. This should improve chances for those who would actually build and use their kit.</li>

                                We’ve been a part of a number of conversations and debates about Vickrey auctions over the last few weeks. This has given us some insight into the questions people have — we’ll address some common ones.

                                Simply put, we don’t believe we can. (Yet.) We care deeply about quality and we put a lot of time and care into checking, assembling, and fulfilling boards. We are increasing volume steadily so that we can address challenges incrementally without being overwhelmed. Meeting current demand would require multiple times as many boards, and we’re not prepared to handle the logistics of such a large run. While increased volume may be a better long-term solution, it will be some time before we get there.

                                To the degree that a single sale can “set” an aftermarket price, the Vickrey auction will set it more appropriately and accurately than if it weren’t run. Consider our running example: the ten winners of the Vickrey auction pay the price of the eleventh highest bidder. The very top bidders are outliers — they’re willing to pay significantly more than even the rest of the winners. Without the auction, those outliers would be the first to buy kits on the aftermarket, creating the impression that the market value is much higher than it truly is. In contrast, the Vickrey auction sale price cannot be influenced by just a few outliers and the price is only set to an amount that at least ten people are willing to pay.

                                If you are a winner and do not pay the determined amount, you can expect high reprecussions. This can range from bans from raffles to ban from any sale of Keycult products.
